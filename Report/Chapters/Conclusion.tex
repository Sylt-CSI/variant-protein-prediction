VIPUR is missing information to give a solid prediction about the deleteriousness of a protein variant and therefore likely suffers from errors in the predictions, SPVAA which uses changes in energy levels could be a more reliable source but also shows its weaknesses within the pace it can asses protein variants, it makes the determination manual and requires background knowledge for the assessment of protein variants. 

 of info that accurate we propsed another method for assessing protein structures within complex which may play a role in machine learning
