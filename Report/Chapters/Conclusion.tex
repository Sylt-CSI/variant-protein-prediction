All methods used to determine structural information are dependent on experimentally determined structures, which are expensive and less common than sequencing methods. At its current state VIPUR is not usable for diagnosing defects within proteins and severe changes should be made to make it usable. SPVAA is only helpful when an expert is available to determine if a mutation has any affect on the protein structure, neither is it at its current state operable for inexperienced users. HOPE is an informative tool that can give decent insights in what the effect of a mutation is and could be helpful for single uses cases but not for large scale.
