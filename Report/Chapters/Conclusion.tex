While VIPUR might be missing information to give a solid prediction about the pathogenicty of a protein variant, the detailed method used for determining the changes in energy levels could be a more reliable source for making predictions based of features.

 of info that accurate we propsed another method for assessing protein structures within complex which may play a role in machine learning
 
 HOPE is informative with the results it produces, easy to use, fast and makes structural problems within proteins diagnoseable and understandable when a missense mutation is discovered. However it does not draw a conclusion and the information it collects depends on: previous publications, conservation and experimental structures, which will give it a disadvantage when limited knowledge is available. Also it does not asses a complex but only a single monomer.
