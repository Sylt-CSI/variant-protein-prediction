The VIPUR approach will be further investigated to test whether the features generated by PSI-BLAST are the main predictors. To measure PSI-BLAST feature importance within VIPUR it first needs to be reverse engineered to make it work with Modeller or another tool which is able to implement mutations in PDB files. Once the reverse engineering is finished VIPURs feature importance is tested with shap\cite{} and or similar methods and software on the VTS.

SPVAA is highly dependent on available resources and currently comes short to display more potential on the cluster where it ran on, which can be resolved by replacing the Rosetta software which tries to minimize structures of mutated models with other software, Or another possibility is by running SPVAA on a different that has more nodes in its cluster and allows setup jobs that use multiple nodes. SPVAA is not a prediction method and has to be drastically modified to become a variant predictor that is able to predict pathogencity or deleteriouness, a good starting point for such a predictor would according to the guidelines predicted in section \ref{subsec:GD_theoratical_large_scale_implementation}.

VIPUR and SPVAA could both be improved in various ways, one of them would be by doing molecular dynamic simulations on the mutated structures to determine the effects of structural changes. With SPVAA it would have most likely become clear if the loss of the disulfide bridge from CYS 62 GLY  in TNFRSF1A would have caused structural issues. VIPUR could benefit from it as new machine learning feature in situations where limited movement is observed and it changes tremendously when a missense mutation occurred in a protein increases with a mutation or vice versa.
