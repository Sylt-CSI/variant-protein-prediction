Within the human genome mutations occur continuously by internal and external factors that substitute, remove, insert or alter the reading frame in a nucleotide sequence. Mutations are not without consequences and can be: beneficial, benign or in most cases pathogenic because they replace a nucleotide which serves a purpose at the specific position in a sequence. Alterations in sequences might lead to a difference in ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcription rates or differences in the RNA transcript that is formed from the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which both can influence the cellular machinery. Mutations outside a gene could less transcription of a protein and inside a gene it could lead to proteins that are: unstable during or after formation, perform less optimal or are not functional \cite{}.

Mutations can be discovered by sequencing the genome, which is routine practice in the healthcare sector \cite{}, resulting in vast amounts of data which all need to be analyzed and can be compared to previously discovered information.

% Some types of mutations can be repaired \cite{}, other mutations are made on purpose\cite{}, incorrectly repaired \cite{} or are irreparable by the available mechanisms \cite{} and will be carried over to the next generation of cells or even to the offspring.
