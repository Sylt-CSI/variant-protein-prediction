Within the human genome mutations occur continuously by internal and external factors that substitute, remove, insert or alter the reading frame of the nucleotide sequences and lengthen or truncates it.  Mutations are not without consequence and can affect: the rate of transcription, the transcript itself and the protein that is formed and can be beneficial or neutral, but most mutations tend to be harmful or pathogenic since they replace nucleotides that are in a specific position. When certain nucleotides are not in the correct position the transcription machinary might nog recognize where it should bind and could therefore ignore it and not transcribe the RNA sequence.

With the lack of these sites proteins might not be formed or if mutated within the sequence  proteins are deformed and not able to function optimally or are even unable to work \cite{}.
