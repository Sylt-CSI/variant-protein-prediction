\subsection{Mutations and its effects in the central dogma of molecular biology}
Within the human genome mutations occur continuously by internal and external factors that substitute, remove, insert or alter the reading frame in a nucleotide sequence. Mutations are not without consequences and can be: beneficial, benign or in most cases pathogenic because they replace a nucleotide which serves a purpose at the specific position in a sequence. Alterations in sequences might lead to a difference in ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcription rates or differences in the RNA transcript that is formed from the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which both can influence the cellular machinery. Mutations outside a gene could less transcription of a protein and inside a gene it could lead to proteins that are: unstable during or after formation, perform less optimal or are not functional \cite{}.

\subsection{A general concept of structural levels within proteins}
The formation of protein structures is classified in different levels, distinctions are made based on bindings and structures that arise from them. 
The order in which amino acids appear in a sequence is called the primary structure, in this level amino acids are only bound to each other by peptide bonds. 
Within a primary structure amino acids can form new peptide bonds between the N and C -terminus of an amino acid, with these bonds 3D structures are made called $\alpha$ helices and $\beta$-sheets that together make up the secondary structure.
More alterations to a single amino acid sequence in the 3D can come from disulfide bridges, ion, hydrogen -bonds, hydrophobic and hydrophilic -interactions formed by the residues of the amino acids, together these bonds form the tertiary structure.
By combining multiple tertiary structures the quaternary structure of a protein can be formed out of the mentioned bonds, bridges and interactions \cite{}.

\subsection{Addition of structural data to diagnostics}

Acquiring information about DNA sequences highly relies on experimental sequencing methods and became cheaper over the years \cite{} and found its use in diagnosing patients within the healthcare sector \cite{}.

From the collected data by genome sequencing experiments most of the analysis is handled in-silico due to the quantities of data that is produced. Proteins often find their use in diagnosing diseases experimentally \cite{}, however in-silico it is often limited to information about conservation in the amino acid sequence which may lead to identical results as by analyzing DNA.

Yet the 3D structure defines how a protein functions \cite{} and by assessing structures of protein variants it becomes possible to determine the change in function and diagnose protein variants that were unclassifiable through finding conservation.

Another advantage of the structural information is that it gives the possibility to develop treatment for diseases that are caused by a mutations. 
With experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) more than 158000 structures \cite{} have been completely revealed, however it is only a tiny fraction of the potential proteins possible without folds \cite{}.

Making 3D structures is currently not common for diagnosis because it is relative expensive and it is difficult to perform with some structures that contain flexible regions where in the positions of atoms is hard to determine the exact position \cite{}.

\subsection{Protein modeling techniques}

An alternative approach to determine structures is based on modeling the protein structure computationally from the amino acid sequence of the desired protein. A downside from computer generated models is that they do not follow the rules of physics and therefore not automatically fold into the correct confirmation. With the method homology modeling sequences of the requested protein are aligned to sequences of known experimental determined structures, based on these alignments a template is formed whereon structural fragments are built, it is not recommended to use this strategy if the sequence identity is less than 20\% since there might not be any structural relation at that point \cite{}.

Another approach is protein threading which relies on the observation of folds in previous determined experimental structures. Based on the occurrence of specific folds a probability is predicted that a certain residue in a protein might fold in that manner. 

Strategies are continuously being improved and developed for proteins to determine the unknown structures, but all have the similar guidelines in avoiding steric hindrance \cite{} and finding the lowest energies based on different scoring systems \cite{}. From the computer generated models many are less accurate than the experimental determined methods and are often compared to them for reference. However the computational models do not have follow the same laws of physics which bottleneck the current experimental methods in for example determining membrane proteins \cite{}.
