\subsection{VIPUR approach}
VIPUR is a machine learning approach for predicting pathogenicity of proteins. The 106 features that were used for machine learning originate mainly (94\%) from the Rosetta software suite (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Rosetta}) applications; DDG monomer (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_DDG_Monomer}), Relax (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}) and Rescore (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Rescore}), the remaining features were collected from PSI-BLAST (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PSI_BLAST}) and Probe (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Probe}). 
All proteins in the VTS of which structures were known or had fragments available were collected from Modbase \cite{} and

SWISS-MODEL \cite{}.

Proteins that did not have a structure within the databases were modeled with Modeller (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Modeller} based on protein fragments that had the highest amino acid sequence identity to the protein.
In some experimental determined structures duplicate chains, ligands, metals and non-standard amino acids were present, these inconsistencies are able to alter the features generated by software and could in some case hinder feature collection, therefor they were removed to make the data homogeneous. Structural mutations of proteins that are in the VTS were introduced by a script using PyMOL (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PyMOL}) by default or PyRosetta (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PyRosetta}) if PyMOL was not available.

\subsection{Simple protein variant analysis approach}
Another approach for determining pathogenicity of a mutation is by assessing energy differences between a wild type and mutant protein residues inside its complex. Analyzing mutations from this perspective gives the ability to view a complex in whole and determine how residues cause perturbations in a complex. Missense mutations in monomers of complexes were made with Modeller (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Modeller}) and the backbone was refined with Rosetta's backrub application (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Backrub}), to lower the energy levels within side chains Rosetta relax (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}). This method shows similarities to that of VIPUR,  was tested with TNFRSF1A (Section \ref{subsec:CD_TNFRSF1A}) and its ligands TNF $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This method keeps: duplicate chains ligands and metals within the structure, water is excluded since it can cause issues with Rosetta tools (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Rosetta:}).

\subsection{Rosetta}
Rosetta is a software suite that has a variety of tools that are developed to aid in macro molecular and antibody ,analysis, design and modeling \cite{}.
% About | RosettaCommons, Rosetta Commons
Both approaches rely on the Relax (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}) for minimizing side chains. VIPUR uses rescore (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Rescore}) to acquire information about protein structures.

Both methods rely on Relax  to minimize energies in the side chains of the remodeled structures. With  DDG monomer  both rely on energy minimization's  in the side chains of the protein structures and need to information on energy changes in 

The scores generated for the machine learning within the VIPUR approach rely on results generated by Rosetta software and to apply this approach the steps are reproduced.  
Several strategies were employed for realizing mutated structures, the first strategy was to identify the whole structure of proteins


 The initial structure of the protein was produced with the application abinitio relax. For the prediction the application requires an amino acid sequence to identify homologous sequences in a curated database. Homologous sequences within the database are found by the BLAST algorithm, when a

Missense mutated proteins have an altered amino acid that can cause differences in interactions with other amino acids, which can influence the backbone or side chain positions of a protein and therefore affect the structure. Software that makes missense mutations in protein structures (Modeller, PyMOL, PyRosetta) tend to replace residues without optimizing, causing odd energy levels or steric hindrance to arise.

\subsubsection{Relax}
Relax was the only application used by both methods which tried to minimize energies in local conformational search space \cite{} within the mutated structures. From each minimization attempt the structure was saved and scores for certain properties were calculated and written into a single file. From this score file VIPUR collected all samples and made 83 features out of it, the detailed approach used the scores from a single structure for its assessment.

\subsubsection{DDG Monomer}
DDG monomer is meant to predict energetic stability of a point mutation in  monomeric protein.The application was used by VIPUR to collect features related to energies and hydrogen, disfulfide, bonds and constraints differences between the wild type and a mutated protein. To execute the tool a script had to be ran that renumbers the wild type pdb file and it requires a "mutation file" that describes the change of a residue based on name and position changes to a different residue \cite{}.

\subsubsection{Rescore}
With this tool Rosetta scores can be calculated based on silent or PDB files proteins structures \cite{} , the output is identical to that is written within the score files produced by Relax (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}).
%Score Commands, Jared
\label{subsubsec:MM_Rescore}

\subsubsection{Backrub}
The backrub application is based on the Monte Carlo method (Section \ref{section:Chap_Monte_Carlo}), and alters a protein by moving its backbone residues with a strategy called fix end move (FEM). With this strategy, groups of residues are selected at random from the structure, it can contain up to: four dihedral, two bond angles and two end points. Both ends of a group are fixated at their position in which a new angle $\alpha$ arises, within this angle residues are pivoted in their natural occurring maximum range of $\pm \ang{10}$ \cite{}.
%Efficient Monte Carlo trial moves for polypeptide simulations, Betancourt
With this method the backbones of newly introduced mutations were altered, for each attempt a new file was generated and a score was written to a score file, from which the lowest Rosetta scoring was selected to be further relaxed (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}).
It was used on the mutated protein to relax the modified backbone structure.
\label{subsubsec:MM_Backrub}

\subsection{PyRosetta}
Is an application programming (API) which has Python bindings (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Python}) for the Rosetta software suite (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Rosetta}), it founds its use in VIPUR when no PyMOL (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PyMOL}) was available to mutate residues within a structure \cite{}.

\subsection{PSI-BLAST}
Position specific iterative basic local alignment search tool (PSI-BLAST) focuses on distant relatives of proteins by making a profile of the sequence and querying it at a protein sequence database. With the generated results a new profile is constructed and queried again, these steps are repeated several times to determine which residues are found in relatives of the protein. The result is a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) which describes the frequency of which residues are substituted by a specific other residue, positive is more, negative is less common \cite{}.

\subsection{Probe}
Probe is able to evaluate atom packing for a single protein or interacting proteins by creating a probe, which is described as a sphere like object, that marks an area with dots when at least two non-covalent atoms are in contact with the probe at the same position \cite{}. VIPUR used this tool to calculate solvent accessible surface area (SASA or ACCP).

\subsection{Robetta prediction server}
The web tool Robetta integrates several tools to form protein structures based on sequence alignments of previously discovered structures also known as homology modeling (Section \ref{}). It requires an amino acid sequence, optionally constrains and fragments can be added to disallow movement of certain structures or add known fragments to avoid calculating pieces that are already known. With this information Robetta search with the help of sequence aligners for known fragments and tries to incorporate them into a single protein structure \cite{}.

\label{subsec:MM_Robetta}

\subsection{I-TASSER prediction server}
The I-TASSER web server is a tool that is able to predict protein structures with a FASTA sequence. The first step it takes is finding structural templates which resemble the sequence by local meta-threading server (LOMETS). LOMETS starts with multiple sequence alignment of which several sequences will undergo protein threading by different programs to form structural templates. The templates are assessed based on the highest alignment Z-score, the program specific confidence score and sequence identity \cite{}.
%LOMETS, Zhang LAB

The known fragments of TNFRSF1A (Section \ref{section:Chap_Cell_Death}) were given as a template to I-TASSER and modeled into a whole protein to make it possible to introduce mutations and predict pathogenicity of a variants.

\subsection{GAVIN Machine Learning Data Table}
Is a collection of nucleotide mutations from rare diseases used by the GAVIN \cite{} machine learning approach. From this set the genes of TNFRSF1A (Section \ref{section:Chap_Cell_Death}) with a missense mutation were filtered (Section \ref{subsec:MM_R}) and written into a format which the variant effect predictor could (VEP) \cite{} could read and translate from nucleotide to protein mutations. The classification of these variants was according to Clinvar significance values \cite{}.

\subsection{GenomAD}
The GenomAD database consists of unified data from large scale genome sequencing data projects and is based on genome reference consortium human genome build 37 human genome 19 (GRCh37/hg19). From this database missense mutations were collected for TNFRSF1A (Section \ref{section:Chap_Cell_Death}), no classification was known for these mutations \cite{}.

\subsection{Python}
Both VIPUR and the pipeline that minimizes backbone (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Backrub}) and side chain energies (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}) were written in Python due to its capabilities, ease of use and because modeller (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Modeller}) for MacOS relies on the system version of Python and does currently not support newer versions besides the one found within the OS of Mac. The mutations that were put together from the different tables (Sections \ref{subsec:MM_GenomAD}, \ref{subsec:MM_Infevers}, \ref{subsec:MM_GAVIN_data_table}) with R {Section \ref{subsec:MM_R}) were filtered by a Python script. To apply each mutation correctly on the proteins in the detailed method a script was written in which files were generated that described in a compact format on which chains and position a mutation resided.
