\subsection{VIPUR approach}
Variant interpretation using Rosetta (VIPUR) is a machine learning approach for predicting deleteriousness of proteins (loss of function) and uses sequential and structural information. To train VIPUR a training set was made that contains sequence and structure features. Structures within the VIPUR training set (VTS) were collected  from Modbase \cite{} and

Proteins that did not have a structure within the VTS were modeled with Modeller (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Modeller} based on protein fragments that had the highest amino acid sequence identity to the protein. Some structures from the databases had: duplicate chains, ligands, metals and non-standard amino acids which were removed to avoid inconsistencies that could alter the features generated by the tools and hinder feature collection within Rosetta tools (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Rosetta}), therefore they were removed to make the data homogeneous.  
For all proteins a mutation file was made that described where and which residues had to be mutated, with this file DDG monomer (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_DDG_Monomer}) can predict changes in the protein structure of which all features are used for prediction. Structural mutations of proteins that are in the VTS were introduced by a script using PyMOL (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PyMOL}) by default or PyRosetta (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PyRosetta}) if PyMOL was not available. After mutation the structure is optimized by the relax application (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}) and produces 50 relaxed structures of a single variant where the properties of each protein are written to a score file of which the quartiles are used as a learning feature. Probe (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Probe})calculated the solvent accessible surface area (SASA/ACCP) of a protein in square {\AA}ngstrom ({\AA}$^2$) which is a structural machine learning feature.  The sequence features of VIPUR are produced by PSI-blast (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PSI_BLAST}) on non mutated sequences and blasted against the NCBI protein database (nr) which results in a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM). From the PSSM scores of the non-mutated, mutated, the difference in scores between non-mutated and mutated, information content and the difference between groups \cite{} are all sequential features for VIPUR.

\subsection{Simple protein variant analysis approach}
Another method for determining function loss in a protein variant is through assessment of difference in energy levels between a wild type and a variant in the complex where it resides. Analyzing mutations from this perspective gives the ability to view a complex in whole and determine how residues cause perturbations in a complex. To make a variant of the wild type, a structure was required wherein a missense mutation could be introduced with Modeller (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Modeller}). The backbone structure of the variant was modified with the backrub application (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Backrub}) to make it better interact with other amino acid backbones in the structure and to further improve the structure side chains were optimized with the Relax application (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}) which makes the protein move into lower energy formations. This method shows similarities to that of VIPUR and was only tested on TNFRSF1A (Section \ref{subsec:CD_TNFRSF1A}) and its ligands TNF $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This method keeps: duplicate chains and protein ligands within the structure, water is excluded since it can cause issues with Rosetta tools (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Rosetta:}).

\subsection{Rosetta}
Rosetta is a software suite that has a variety of tools that are developed to aid in macro molecular and antibody ,analysis, design and modeling \cite{}.
% About | RosettaCommons, Rosetta Commons
Both approaches rely on the Relax (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}) for minimizing side chains. VIPUR uses rescore (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Rescore}) to acquire information about protein structures.

Both methods rely on Relax  to minimize energies in the side chains of the remodeled structures. With  DDG monomer  both rely on energy minimization's  in the side chains of the protein structures and need to information on energy changes in 

The scores generated for the machine learning within the VIPUR approach rely on results generated by Rosetta software and to apply this approach the steps are reproduced.

Missense mutated proteins have an altered amino acid that can cause differences in interactions with other amino acids, which can influence the backbone or side chain positions of a protein and therefore affect the structure. Software that makes missense mutations in protein structures (Modeller, PyMOL, PyRosetta) tend to replace residues without optimizing, causing odd energy levels or steric hindrance to arise.

\subsubsection{Relax}
Relax was the only application used by both methods which tried to minimize energies in local conformational search space \cite{} within the mutated structures. From each minimization attempt the structure was saved and scores for certain properties were calculated and written into a single file. From this score file VIPUR collected all samples and made 83 features out of it, the detailed approach used the scores from a single structure for its assessment.

\subsubsection{DDG Monomer}
DDG monomer is meant to predict energetic stability of a point mutation in  monomeric protein.The application was used by VIPUR to collect features related to energies and hydrogen, disfulfide, bonds and constraints differences between the wild type and a mutated protein. To execute the tool a script had to be ran that renumbers the wild type pdb file and it requires a "mutation file" that describes the change of a residue based on name and position changes to a different residue \cite{}.

\subsubsection{Rescore}
With this tool Rosetta scores can be calculated based on silent or PDB files proteins structures \cite{} , the output is identical to that is written within the score files produced by Relax (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}).
%Score Commands, Jared
\label{subsubsec:MM_Rescore}

\subsubsection{Backrub}
The backrub application is based on the Monte Carlo method (Section \ref{section:Chap_Monte_Carlo}), and alters a protein by moving its backbone residues with a strategy called fix end move (FEM). With this strategy, groups of residues are selected at random from the structure, it can contain up to: four dihedral, two bond angles and two end points. Both ends of a group are fixated at their position in which a new angle $\alpha$ arises, within this angle residues are pivoted in their natural occurring maximum range of $\pm \ang{10}$ \cite{}.
%Efficient Monte Carlo trial moves for polypeptide simulations, Betancourt
With this method the backbones of newly introduced mutations were altered, for each attempt a new file was generated and a score was written to a score file, from which the lowest Rosetta scoring was selected to be further relaxed (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}).
It was used on the mutated protein to relax the modified backbone structure.

\subsection{PyRosetta}
Is an application programming (API) which has Python bindings (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Python}) for the Rosetta software suite (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Rosetta}), it founds its use in VIPUR when no PyMOL (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PyMOL}) was available to mutate residues within a structure \cite{}.

\subsection{PSI-BLAST}
Position specific iterative basic local alignment search tool (PSI-BLAST) focuses on distant relatives of proteins by making a profile of the sequence and querying it at a protein sequence database. With the generated results a new profile is constructed and queried again, these steps are repeated several times to determine which residues are found in relatives of the protein. The result is a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) which describes the frequency of which residues are substituted by a specific other residue, positive is more, negative is less common \cite{}.

Probe is able to evaluate atom packing for a single protein or interacting proteins by creating a probe, which is described as a sphere like object, that marks an area with dots when at least two non-covalent atoms are in contact with the probe at the same position \cite{}. VIPUR used this tool to calculate solvent accessible surface area (SASA or ACCP).

\subsection{Robetta prediction server}
The web tool Robetta integrates several tools to form protein structures based on sequence alignments of previously discovered structures also known as homology modeling (Section \ref{}). It requires an amino acid sequence, optionally constrains and fragments can be added to disallow movement of certain structures or add known fragments to avoid calculating pieces that are already known. With this information Robetta search with the help of sequence aligners for known fragments and tries to incorporate them into a single protein structure \cite{}.

\subsection{I-TASSER prediction server}
The I-TASSER web server is a tool that is able to predict protein structures with a FASTA sequence. The first step it takes is finding structural templates which resemble the sequence by local meta-threading server (LOMETS). LOMETS starts with multiple sequence alignment of which several sequences will undergo protein threading by different programs to form structural templates. The templates are assessed based on the highest alignment Z-score, the program specific confidence score and sequence identity \cite{}.

The known fragments of TNFRSF1A (Section \ref{section:Chap_Cell_Death}) were given as a template to I-TASSER and modeled into a whole protein to make it possible to introduce mutations and predict pathogenicity of a variants.
