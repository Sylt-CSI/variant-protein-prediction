\subsection{VIPUR approach}
Variant interpretation using Rosetta (VIPUR) is a machine learning approach for predicting deleteriousness of proteins (loss of function) and uses sequential and structural information. To train VIPUR a training set was made that contains sequence and structure features. Structures within the VIPUR training set (VTS) were collected  from Modbase \cite{} and
% modbase, a database of annotated comparative protein structure models and associated resources, pieper
SWISS-MODEL \cite{}.

% SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes, Waterhouse
Proteins that did not have a structure within the VTS were modeled with Modeller (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Modeller} based on protein fragments that had the highest amino acid sequence identity to the protein. Some structures from the databases had: duplicate chains, ligands, metals and non-standard amino acids which were removed to avoid inconsistencies that could alter the features generated by the tools and hinder feature collection within Rosetta tools (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Rosetta}), therefore they were removed to make the data homogeneous.  
For all proteins a mutation file was made that described where and which residues had to be mutated, with this file DDG monomer (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_DDG_Monomer}) can predict changes in the protein structure of which all features are used for prediction. Structural mutations of proteins that are in the VTS were introduced by a script using PyMOL (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PyMOL}) by default or PyRosetta (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PyRosetta}) if PyMOL was not available. After mutation the structure is optimized by the relax application (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}) and produces 50 relaxed structures of a single variant where the properties of each protein are written to a score file of which the quartiles are used as a learning feature. Probe (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Probe})calculated the solvent accessible surface area (SASA/ACCP) of a protein in square {\AA}ngstrom ({\AA}$^2$) which is a structural machine learning feature.  The sequence features of VIPUR are produced by PSI-blast (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PSI_BLAST}) on non mutated sequences and blasted against the NCBI protein database (nr) which results in a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM). From the PSSM scores of the non-mutated, mutated, the difference in scores between non-mutated and mutated, information content and the difference between groups \cite{} are all sequential features for VIPUR.

% Rational Design of Temperature-Sensitive Alleles Using Computational Structure Prediction, Poultney et al.
With 106 features generated by the mentioned tools deleteriousness of a protein variant is determined with sparse logistic regression. The term sparse implies that a limited set of features was used because the weights "shrink" to 0 with regularization \cite{}.

\subsection{Simple protein variant analysis approach}
Another method for determining function loss in a protein variant is through assessment of difference in energy levels between a wild type and a variant in the complex where it resides. Analyzing mutations from this perspective gives the ability to view a complex in whole and determine how residues cause perturbations in a complex. To make a variant of the wild type, a structure was required wherein a missense mutation could be introduced with Modeller (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Modeller}). The backbone structure of the variant was modified with the backrub application (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Backrub}) to make it better interact with other amino acid backbones in the structure resulting in 1000 models. The lowest Rosetta scoring (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Rosetta}) one would be selected to further improve the side chains with the Relax application
 (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}) which makes the side chains of the protein move into lower energy formations. From these 64 models were made where its energies levels were compared to the native structure to determine the effects a mutation would have on the protein, the lowest scoring ones were used as figures. This method shows similarities to that of VIPUR and was only tested on TNFRSF1A (Section \ref{subsec:CD_TNFRSF1A}) and its ligands TNF $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This method keeps: duplicate chains and protein ligands within the structure, water is excluded since it can cause issues with Rosetta tools (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Rosetta}). This procedure with these steps is defined as the Simple protein variant analysis approach (SPVAA).

\subsection{Rosetta}
Rosetta is a software suite that has a variety of tools that are developed to aid in macro molecular and antibody ,analysis, design and prediction \cite{}.
% About | RosettaCommons, Rosetta Commons
However no tools in the suite have been encountered that could introduce missense mutations in the proteins and has been dealt with by other software (Sections \ref{subsec:MM_PyMOL}, \ref{subsec:MM_PyRosetta}, \ref{subsec:MM_Modeller}). With the introduced mutations water had to be removed because some tools cannot predict structures well with: water, metals and amino acids that are no part of the standard (20) amino acids \cite{}.
%How to prepare structures for use in Rosetta, Rosetta commons

Within the tools from Rosetta various scores are assigned to different properties related to bonds, interactions, energies and geometries within structures and are written to a score file. From all different scoring metrics the Rosetta score or Rosetta energy unit (REU) , which is the total\_score in the score files, can be used to compare models made from the same protein per tool. Not only is the score based on energy but also it has statistical terms which influence the score based on known favorable folds from existing structures that reside in the curated Rosetta database \cite{}. In summary a lower Rosetta score would make a more natural model.

\subsubsection{Relax}
The Relax application was used by VIPUR and by SPVAA to relax the side chains to minimize energy levels within the local conformational search space \cite{} of the structure, it determines the most likely energy levels with the Monte Carlo method (Section \ref{section:Chap_Monte_Carlo}) and after a certain set of moves it produces a structure and stars anew\cite{}. Scores from each produced by Relax were written into a single score file.

\subsubsection{DDG Monomer}
DDG monomer is meant to predict energetic stability of a point mutation in  monomeric protein.The application was used by VIPUR to collect features related to energies and hydrogen, disfulfide, bonds and constraints differences between the wild type and a mutated protein. To execute the tool a script had to be ran that renumbers the wild type pdb file and it requires a "mutation file" that describes the change of a residue based on name and position changes to a different residue \cite{}.

\subsubsection{Rescore}
With this tool Rosetta scores can be calculated based on silent or PDB files proteins structures \cite{} , the output is identical to that is written within the score files produced by Relax (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}).
%Score Commands, Jared
\label{subsubsec:MM_Rescore}

\subsubsection{Backrub}
The backrub application is based on the Monte Carlo method (Section \ref{section:Chap_Monte_Carlo}), and alters a protein by moving its backbone residues with a strategy called fix end move (FEM). With this strategy, groups of residues are selected at random from the structure, it can contain up to: four dihedral, two bond angles and two end points. Both ends of a group are fixated at their position in which a new angle $\alpha$ arises, within this angle residues are pivoted in their natural occurring maximum range of $\pm \ang{10}$ \cite{}.
%Efficient Monte Carlo trial moves for polypeptide simulations, Betancourt
With this method the backbones of newly introduced mutations were altered, for each attempt a new file was generated and a score was written to a score file, from which the lowest Rosetta scoring was selected to be further relaxed (Section \ref{subsubsec:MM_Relax}).
It was used on the mutated protein to relax the modified backbone structure.

\subsection{PyRosetta}
Is an application programming (API) which has Python bindings (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Python}) for the Rosetta software suite (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Rosetta}), it founds its use in VIPUR when no PyMOL (Section \ref{subsec:MM_PyMOL}) was available to mutate residues within a structure \cite{}.

\subsection{PSI-BLAST}
Position specific iterative basic local alignment search tool (PSI-BLAST) focuses on distant relatives of proteins by making a profile of the sequence and querying it at a protein sequence database. With the generated results a new profile is constructed and queried again, these steps are repeated several times to determine which residues are found in relatives of the protein. The result is a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) which describes the frequency of which residues are substituted by a specific other residue, positive is more, negative is less common \cite{}.

\subsection{Probe}
Probe is able to evaluate atom packing for a single protein or interacting proteins by creating a probe, which is described as a sphere like object, that marks an area with dots when at least two non-covalent atoms are in contact with the probe at the same position \cite{}. VIPUR used this tool to calculate solvent accessible surface area (SASA or ACCP).

\subsection{Robetta prediction server}
The web tool Robetta integrates several tools to form protein structures based on sequence alignments of previously discovered structures also known as homology modeling (Section \ref{subsec:GD_Protein_modeling_techniques}).
It requires an amino acid sequence, optionally constrains and fragments can be added to disallow movement of certain structures or add known fragments to avoid calculating pieces that are already known. With this information Robetta search with the help of sequence aligners for known fragments and tries to incorporate them into a single protein structure \cite{}.

\subsection{I-TASSER prediction server}
The I-TASSER web server is a tool that is able to predict protein structures with a FASTA sequence. The first step it takes is finding structural templates which resemble the sequence by local meta-threading server (LOMETS). LOMETS starts with multiple sequence alignment of which several sequences will undergo protein threading by different programs to form structural templates. The templates are assessed based on the highest alignment Z-score, the program specific confidence score and sequence identity \cite{}.

The classification of these variants was according to Clinvar significance values \cite{}.

\subsection{HOPE}
Have yOur Protein Explained (HOPE) is a web service that collects information of about a user specified missense mutation in a protein and comes from various sources. Uniprot (Section \ref{subsec:MM_Uniprot}) is queried with BLAST to find homologous sequences and structures, other features that are found on Uniprot are active sites, domains and various other sequence features that help to identify the function of a region. From the BLAST results homology models are made with Yasara that are sent of to WHAT IF web services that calculate structural information about the protein. Before the formation of a report all information is put into a decision tree to asses mutational effects in contexts of: contacts, structural locations, non-structural features, previous variant information and amino acid properties to form an automated report \cite{}.
