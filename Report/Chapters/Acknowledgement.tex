This graduation project has taken place at Universitary Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) at the Department of Genetics within the genomics coordination center (GCC), this report has been written for the GCC to gain insight into structural data to improve the GAVIN variant predictor. I want to thank Joeri van der Velde for supervising me during this project and helping me with writing this report. I also would like to thank Benjamin Kant and Marielle van Gijn for helping me decide to focus on assessing tumor necrosis factor associated receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). And I especially would like to thank Tsjerk Wassenaar for informing us about the function and structure of TNFRSF1A, giving us the appropriate protein structures to work with and steering this project into a meaningful direction.
