We present {VIPUR}, a computational framework that seamlessly integrates sequence analysis and structural modelling (using the Rosetta protein modelling suite) to identify and interpret deleterious protein variants. To train {VIPUR}, we collected 9477 protein variants with known effects on protein function from multiple organisms and curated structural models for each variant from crystal structures and homology models. {VIPUR} can be applied to mutations in any organism's proteome with improved generalized accuracy ({AUROC} .83) and interpretability ({AUPR} .87) compared to other methods. We demonstrate that {VIPUR}'s predictions of deleteriousness match the biological phenotypes in {ClinVar} and provide a clear ranking of prediction confidence. We use {VIPUR} to interpret known mutations associated with inflammation and diabetes, demonstrating the structural diversity of disrupted functional sites and improved interpretation of mutations associated with human diseases. Lastly, we demonstrate {VIPUR}'s ability to highlight candidate variants associated with human diseases by applying {VIPUR} to de novo variants associated with autism spectrum disorders.},

However, finding ts mutations typically relies on generating and screening many thousands of mutations, which is an expensive and labor-intensive process. Here we describe an in silico method that uses Rosetta and machine learning techniques to predict a highly accurate “top 5” list of ts mutations given the structure of a protein of interest. Rosetta is a protein structure prediction and design code, used here to model and score how proteins accommodate point mutations with side-chain and backbone movements. We show that integrating Rosetta relax-derived features with sequence-based features results in accurate temperature-sensitive mutation predictions.},

	abstract = {Background Tumor necrosis factor ({TNF}) is a powerful cytokine that is involved in immune and pro-inflammatory responses. Two {TNF} receptors that belong to the cysteine-rich low affinity nerve growth factor receptor family ({TNF}-R1 and {TNF}-R2) are the sole mediators of {TNF} signalling. Signalling is thought to occur when a trimer of {TNF} binds to the extracellular domains of two or three receptor molecules, which permits aggregation and activation of the cytoplasmic domains. The complex is then internalized within an endocytic vesicle, whereupon it dissociates at low {pH}. Structure of the soluble extracellular domain of the receptor ({sTNF}-R1) both in the unliganded and {TNF}-bound state have previously been determined. In both instances, the fourth subdomain of the receptor was found to be partly disordered. In the unliganded state at {pH} 7.5, the extracellular domain forms two distinct types of dimer, parallel and antiparallel; the antiparallel dimer occludes the {TNF}-binding. Results We have determined the structure of {sTNF}-R1 in two crystal forms in high salt at {pH} 3.7. The orthorhombic crystals diffract to 1.85 åand the entire polypeptide is well ordered. In contrast, the C-terminal 32 residues are disordered in the hexagonal crystals. In the orthorhombic form, these residues exhibit a topology and disulphide connectivity that differs from the other three cysteine-rich domains in the molecule. In both forms, the interface is considerably more extensive than that used in complex formation with {LTα}. This ‘ low {pH} ’ dimer is different from both of the dimers observed in crystals grown at {pH} 7.5. Conclusions The occurrence of the antiparallel dimers in both low {pH} crystal forms suggest that they are not an artefact of crystal packing. Such dimers may form in the low {pH} environment of the endosome. Because the dimer contact surface occludes the {TNF}-binding site, formation of this dimer would dissociate the {TNF}–receptor complex within the endosome. Three of the four cysteine-rich domains of {TNF}-R1 are constructed from two distinct structural modules, termed A1 and B2. The fourth subdomain comprises an A1 module followed by an unusual C2 module. Although the orientation of these modules with respect to each other is sensitive to crystal packing, ligand binding, {pH} and ionic strength, the modules are structurally well conserved between and within the known {sTNF}-R1 structures.},

We have identified and characterized a novel, rapidly inducible cell surface cytotoxic integral transmembrane form of {TNF}. The existence and behavior of this novel form of {TNF} may explain the complex physiology of this molecule. We suggest that activated monocytes synthesize transmembrane {TNF} at the site of inflammation and kill their targets by either cell-to cell contact or local release of the {TNF} secretory component. In contrast, septic shock and cachexia may result from either acute or chronic systemic activation of monocytes, resulting in the widespread release of {TN} F secretory component into the circulation of the affected individual. We further suggest that cell borne cytokines and cytotoxins may be the primary mediators of directed inflammatory responses.},

	abstract = {Cellular processes often depend on interactions between proteins and the formation of macromolecular complexes. The impairment of such interactions can lead to deregulation of pathways resulting in disease states, and it is hence crucial to gain insights into the nature of macromolecular assemblies. Detailed structural knowledge about complexes and protein-protein interactions is growing, but experimentally determined three-dimensional multimeric assemblies are outnumbered by complexes supported by non-structural experimental evidence. Here, we aim to fill this gap by modeling multimeric structures by homology, only using amino acid sequences to infer the stoichiometry and the overall structure of the assembly. We ask which properties of proteins within a family can assist in the prediction of correct quaternary structure. Specifically, we introduce a description of protein-protein interface conservation as a function of evolutionary distance to reduce the noise in deep multiple sequence alignments. We also define a distance measure to structurally compare homologous multimeric protein complexes. This allows us to hierarchically cluster protein structures and quantify the diversity of alternative biological assemblies known today. We find that a combination of conservation scores, structural clustering, and classical interface descriptors, can improve the selection of homologous protein templates leading to reliable models of protein complexes.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose {LIME}, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

Its advantage over existing general methods is that all subsets of input features are perturbed, so interactions and redundancies between features are taken into account. Furthermore, when explaining an additive model, the method is equivalent to commonly used additive model-specific methods. We illustrate the method's usefulness with examples from artificial and real-world data sets and an empirical analysis of running times. Results from a controlled experiment with 122 participants suggest that the method's explanations improved the participants' understanding of the model.},

Although machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, they have in most cases the disadvantage of acting as a black box, not providing any information about what made them arrive at a particular decision. This work proposes a general solution to the problem of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest. We evaluate our method for classifiers trained on {PASCAL} {VOC} 2009 images, synthetic image data containing geometric shapes, the {MNIST} handwritten digits data set and for the pre-trained {ImageNet} model available as part of the Caffe open source package.},

A fine-grained representation can approximate the actual structure more accurately, but may require many more degrees of freedom than a coarse-grained representation and hence make conformational search more challenging. We investigate this tradeoff between the accuracy and the size of protein conformational search space for two frequently used representations: one with fixed bond angles and lengths and one that has full flexibility. We performed large-scale explorations of the energy landscapes of 82 protein domains under each model, and find that the introduction of bond angle flexibility significantly increases the average energy gap between native and non-native structures. We also find that incorporating bonded geometry flexibility improves low resolution X-ray crystallographic refinement. These results suggest that backbone bond angle relaxation makes an important contribution to native structure energetics, that current energy functions are sufficiently accurate to capture the energetic gain associated with subtle deformations from chain ideality, and more speculatively, that backbone geometry distortions occur late in protein folding to optimize packing in the native state.},

Crystallography provides a high-resolution description of protein structure in the crystal environment, while {NMR} describes structure in solution but using less data. {NMR} structures display more variability, but is this because crystal contacts are absent or because of fewer data constraints? Here we report unexpected insight into this issue obtained through analysis of detailed protein energy landscapes generated by large-scale, native-enhanced sampling of conformational space with Rosetta@home for 111 protein domains. In the absence of tightly associating binding partners or ligands, the lowest-energy Rosetta models were nearly all {\textless}2.5 Å {CαRMSD} from the experimental structure; this result demonstrates that structure prediction accuracy for globular proteins is limited mainly by the ability to sample close to the native structure. While the lowest-energy models are similar to deposited structures, they are not identical; the largest deviations are most often in regions involved in ligand, quaternary, or crystal contacts. For ligand binding proteins, the low energy models may resemble the apo structures, and for oligomeric proteins, the monomeric assembly intermediates. The deviations between the low energy models and crystal structures largely disappear when landscapes are computed in the context of the crystal lattice or multimer. The computed low-energy ensembles, with tight crystal-structure-like packing in the core, but more {NMR}-structure-like variability in loops, may in some cases resemble the native state ensembles of proteins better than individual crystal or {NMR} structures, and can suggest experimentally testable hypotheses relating alternative states and structural heterogeneity to function.},

Elsewhere we have described six disease-associated {TNFRSF}1A mutations, five of which disrupt extracellular cysteines involved in disulfide bonds; four other mutations have subsequently been reported. Among 150 additional patients with unexplained periodic fevers, we have identified four novel {TNFRSF}1A mutations (H22Y, C33G, S86P, and c.193-14 G--{\textgreater}A), one mutation (C30S) described by another group, and two substitutions (P46L and R92Q) present in approximately 1\% of control chromosomes. The increased frequency of P46L and R92Q among patients with periodic fever, as well as functional studies of {TNFRSF}1A, argue that these are low-penetrance mutations rather than benign polymorphisms. The c.193-14 G--{\textgreater}A mutation creates a splice-acceptor site upstream of exon 3, resulting in a transcript encoding four additional extracellular amino acids. T50M and c.193-14 G--{\textgreater}A occur at {CpG} hotspots, and haplotype analysis is consistent with recurrent mutations at these sites. In contrast, although R92Q also arises at a {CpG} motif, we identified a common founder chromosome in unrelated individuals with this substitution. Genotype-phenotype studies identified, as carriers of cysteine mutations, 13 of 14 patients with {TRAPS} and amyloidosis and indicated a lower penetrance of {TRAPS} symptoms in individuals with noncysteine mutations. In two families with dominantly inherited disease and in 90 sporadic cases that presented with a compatible clinical history, we have not identified any {TNFRSF}1A mutation, despite comprehensive genomic sequencing of all of the exons, therefore suggesting further genetic heterogeneity of the periodic-fever syndromes.},

The scoring function consists of several types of physical potential energy terms and homology-derived restraints. The optimization method implements a combination of conjugate gradient minimization and molecular dynamics with simulated annealing. The testing set consists of 717 pairs of known protein structures differing by a single mutation. Twelve variations of the scoring function were tested in three different environments of the mutated residue. The best-performing protocol optimizes all the atoms of the mutated residue, with respect to a scoring function that includes molecular mechanics energy terms for bond distances, angles, dihedral angles, peptide bond planarity, and non-bonded atomic contacts represented by Lennard-Jones potential, dihedral angle restraints derived from the aligned homologous structure, and a statistical potential for non-bonded atomic interactions extracted from a large set of known protein structures. The current method compares favorably with other tested approaches, especially when predicting long and flexible side-chains. In addition to the thoroughness of the conformational search, sampled degrees of freedom, and the scoring function type, the accuracy of the method was also evaluated as a function of the flexibility of the mutated side-chain, the relative volume change of the mutated residue, and its residue type. The results suggest that further improvement is likely to be achieved by concentrating on the improvement of the scoring function, in addition to or instead of increasing the variety of sampled conformations.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.
In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see cellular Potts model, interacting particle systems, {McKean}–Vlasov processes, kinetic models of gases). Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and, in maths, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals  with complicated boundary conditions.  In application to systems engineering problems (space, oil exploration, aircraft design, etc.), Monte Carlo–based predictions of failure, cost overruns and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative "soft" methods.In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the sample mean) of independent samples of the variable. When the probability distribution of the variable is parametrized, mathematicians often use a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution. That is, in the limit, the samples being generated by the {MCMC} method will be samples from the desired (target) distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the stationary distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of the random states of the {MCMC} sampler.
In other problems, the objective is generating draws from a sequence of probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution equation. These flows of probability distributions can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depend on the distributions of the current random states (see {McKean}–Vlasov processes, nonlinear filtering equation). In other instances we are given a flow of probability distributions with an increasing level of sampling complexity (path spaces models with an increasing time horizon, Boltzmann–Gibbs measures associated with decreasing temperature parameters, and many others). These models can also be seen as the evolution of the law of the random states of a nonlinear Markov chain.  A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample a large number of copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled empirical measures. In contrast with traditional Monte Carlo and {MCMC} methodologies these mean field particle techniques rely on sequential interacting samples. The terminology mean field reflects the fact that each of the samples (a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or phenotypes) interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical interaction between particles vanishes.},

	abstract = {De Monte-Carlosimulatie is een simulatietechniek waarbij een fysiek proces niet één keer maar vele malen wordt gesimuleerd, elke keer met andere startcondities. Het resultaat van deze verzameling simulaties is een verdelingsfunctie die het hele gebied van mogelijke uitkomsten weergeeft.
De term Monte-Carlo is afgeleid van het beroemde casino uit Monte Carlo. Dat betekent niet dat het een methode is die gebaseerd is op gokken. Het refereert aan de manier waarop, voor elke nieuwe simulatie (een van de vele), de startcondities worden bepaald, uitgaande van een verzameling van reëel te verwachten condities.
Monte-Carlosimulaties worden in verschillende wetenschappelijke toepassingen gebruikt, zoals bij verschillende {NASA}-projecten waar onzekerheden een belangrijke rol spelen. Ook economische problemen maken veelvuldig gebruik van Monte-Carlosimulaties.
De Monte-Carlomethode wordt meestal toegepast in situaties waarin:

Het resultaat van een enkele simulatie niet voldoende representatief is in verband met de in werkelijkheid te verwachten variatie van (of onzekerheid met betrekking tot) de startcondities.
De variatie of onzekerheid van die startcondities bekend is of met voldoende betrouwbaarheid ingeschat en gekwantificeerd kan worden.De Monte-Carlosimulatietechniek is alleen maar mogelijk dankzij de beschikbaarheid van computers. Immers, een enkele simulatie op zich vraagt in het algemeen al veel rekenkracht. Deze simulatie moet nu, afhankelijk van het gewenste betrouwbaarheidsniveau tientallen tot enkele duizenden malen herhaald worden, elke keer met een nieuwe set invoervariabelen.},

However, a good consensus prediction relies on the accuracy of individual methods. This article reports our efforts to further improve a single-method fold recognition technique called {SPARKS} by changing the alignment scoring function and incorporating the {SPINE}-X techniques that make improved prediction of secondary structure, backbone torsion angle and solvent accessible surface area., Results: The new method called {SPARKS}-X was tested with the {SALIGN} benchmark for alignment accuracy, Lindahl and {SCOP} benchmarks for fold recognition, and {CASP} 9 blind test for structure prediction. The method is compared to several state-of-the-art techniques such as {HHPRED} and {BoostThreader}. Results show that {SPARKS}-X is one of the best single-method fold recognition techniques. We further note that incorporating multiple templates and refinement in model building will likely further improve {SPARKS}-X., Availability: The method is available as a {SPARKS}-X server at http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu/, Contact: yqzhou@iupui.edu},

	abstract = {Filling in the protein fold picture
Fewer than a third of the 14,849 known protein families have at least one member with an experimentally determined structure. This leaves more than 5000 protein families with no structural information. Protein modeling using residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary data has been successful in modeling unknown structures, but it requires large numbers of aligned sequences. Ovchinnikov et al. augmented such sequence alignments with metagenome sequence data (see the Perspective by Söding). They determined the number of sequences required to allow modeling, developed criteria for model quality, and, where possible, improved modeling by matching predicted contacts to known structures. Their method predicted quality structural models for 614 protein families, of which about 140 represent newly discovered protein folds.
Science, this issue p. 294; see also p. 248
Despite decades of work by structural biologists, there are still {\textasciitilde}5200 protein families with unknown structure outside the range of comparative modeling. We show that Rosetta structure prediction guided by residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary information can accurately model proteins that belong to large families and that metagenome sequence data more than triple the number of protein families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling. We then integrate metagenome data, contact-based structure matching, and Rosetta structure calculations to generate models for 614 protein families with currently unknown structures; 206 are membrane proteins and 137 have folds not represented in the Protein Data Bank. This approach provides the representative models for large protein families originally envisioned as the goal of the Protein Structure Initiative at a fraction of the cost.
Combining metagenome data with protein structure prediction generates models for 614 families with unknown structures.

Different types of {BLASTs} are available according to the query sequences. For example, following the discovery of a previously unknown gene in the mouse, a scientist will typically perform a {BLAST} search of the human genome to see if humans carry a similar gene; {BLAST} will identify sequences in the human genome that resemble the mouse gene based on similarity of sequence. The {BLAST} algorithm and program were designed by Stephen Altschul, Warren Gish, Webb Miller, Eugene Myers, and David J.

This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program {MODELLER} and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications.

It allows one both to measure and to visualize directly the goodness-of-fit of packing interactions. It requires both highly accurate structures and also the explicit inclusion of all hydrogen atoms and their van der Waals interactions. A reference dataset of 100 protein structures was chosen on the basis of resolution (1.7 Å or better), crystallographic R-value, non-homology, and the absence of any unusual problems. Hydrogen atoms were added in standard geometry and, where needed, with rotational optimization of {OH}, {SH}, and {NH}3+ positions. Side-chain amide orientations were corrected where required by {NH} van der Waals clashes, as described in the accompanying paper. It was determined that, in general, methyl groups pack well in the default staggered conformation, except for the terminal methyl groups of methionine residues, which required rotational optimization. The distribution of serious clashes (i.e. non-H-bond overlap of ⩾0.4 Å) was studied as a function of resolution, alternate conformations, and temperature factor (B), leading to the decision that packing and other structural features would not be analyzed for residues in ‘b’ alternate conformations or with B-factors of 40 or above. At the level of the fine details analyzed here, structural accuracy improves quite significantly over the range from 1.7 to 1.0 Å resolution. These high-resolution structures show impressively well-fitted packing interactions, with some regions thoroughly interdigitated and other regions somewhat sparser. Lower-resolution structures or model structures could undoubtedly be improved in accuracy by the incorporation of this additional information: for example, nucleic acid structures in non-canonical conformations are often very accurate for the bases and much less reliable for the backbone, whose conformation could be specified better by including explicit H atom geometry and contacts. The contact dots are an extremely sensitive method of finding problem areas, and often they can suggest how to make improvements. They can also provide explanations for structural features that have been described only as empirical regularities, which is illustrated by showing that the commonest rotamer of methionine (a left-handed spiral, with all χ values near −60°) is preferred because it provides up to five good H atom van der Waals contacts. This methodology is thus applicable in two different ways: (1) for finding and correcting errors in structure models (either experimental or theoretical); and (2) for analyzing interaction patterns in the molecules themselves.},

Consensus models are generated from the top predictions of the component-threading servers, which are at least 7\% more accurate than the best individual servers based on {TM}-score at a t-test significance level of 0.1\%. Moreover, side-chain and C-alpha (Cα) contacts of 42 and 61\% accuracy respectively, as well as long- and short-range distant maps, are automatically constructed from the threading alignments. These data can be easily used as constraints to guide the ab initio procedures such as {TASSER} for further protein tertiary structure modeling.

Both proteins have been found to be specifically toxic to many tumour cells. Furthermore, it has been reported that various interferons are synergistic with {TNF} for anti-tumour effects in vitro6–8, while activities attributed to the two proteins have also been shown to necrotize various tumours in vivo2,3,9. We have now prepared 125I-labelled highly purified recombinant human {TNF}-α to study in detail its binding to the human cervical carcinoma cell line {ME}-180. Our results indicate that there is a single class of specific high-affinity receptors for {TNF} on this cell line which has a Kd of about 0.2 {nM} and an average of 2,000 receptor sites per cell. The binding of labelled {TNF}-α to these cells can be inhibited by both {TNF}-α and {TNF}-β but not by γ-interferon ({IFN}-γ). However, preincubation of cells with {IFN}-γ increases the total number of {TNF} receptors two to threefold without any significant change in the affinity constant. This is the first report that {TNF}-α and -β share a common receptor and that the receptors can be up-regulated by interferon. Our results may explain previous observations regarding similar biological activities observed for these two cytotoxic proteins and also their synergistic action with interferons.},

The death domain of {TRADD} contains the nuclear import sequence and expression of the core death domain (nuclear {TRADD}) results in exclusive nuclear localization and activation of a distinct apoptotic pathway. Cytoplasmic {TRADD} activates apoptosis through Fas-associated death domain protein ({FADD}) and caspase-8 activation that was blocked by caspase inhibitors or dominant-negative {FADD}. These inhibitors did not inhibit death induced by nuclear {TRADD}, which could only be inhibited by combining caspase inhibitors and a serine protease inhibitor. The pathway activated by nuclear {TRADD} requires caspase-9 catalytic activity. However, apoptosis activating factor deficiency confers only partial protection from death. This pathway represents an alternate means by which {TRADD} can regulate cell death independently of {FADD} and caspase-8 that occurs from the nucleus rather than the cytoplasm.},

The structure of the type I {TNF} receptor extracellular domain ({sTNF}-R1), crystallized in the absence of {TNF}, has now been determined at 2.25-Å resolution. The receptor itself is an elongated molecule comprising four disulfide-rich domains in a nearly linear array. Contrary to expectations, the unliganded domains are found to associate into dimers of two distinct types, in which monomers are related by local two-fold axes of symmetry. In one case, the receptors are antiparallel to each other and associate through an interface that overlaps the {TNF} binding site. If intact receptors were capable of such an association, their cytoplasmic domains would be separated by over 100 Å. This interaction could inhibit signaling in the absence of {TNF}. Parallel dimers are also observed in which the dimer interface is well separated from the {TNF} binding site. Associations among {TNF}-bound parallel dimers could cause receptor clustering. Both dimers bury substantial areas of protein surface and are formed by polar and non-polar interactions.},

Alterations of protein structure, and the resulting consequences on dynamics, can affect the outcome of laboratory tests. These changes can be a result of mutations, other in vivo factors, or even the experimental conditions of the diagnostic test.
Approach: The relationship between protein structure and dynamics and experimentally observable properties used in diagnostic assays are discussed in light of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or prion diseases.
Content: This review describes current efforts and possible future directions of prion diagnostic development. Recent advances in therapeutic development are also addressed.
Summary: The intent of the review is to highlight the role of protein dynamics and conformational change in protein-based diagnostics and treatments for prion disease.},

	abstract = {Protein structure is the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in an amino acid-chain molecule. Proteins are polymers –  specifically polypeptides –  formed from sequences of amino acids, the monomers of the polymer.  A single amino acid monomer may also be called a residue indicating a repeating unit of a polymer. Proteins form by amino acids undergoing condensation reactions, in which the amino acids lose one water molecule per reaction in order to attach to one another with a peptide bond. By convention, a chain under 30 amino acids is often identified as a peptide, rather than a protein. To be able to perform their biological function, proteins fold into one or more specific spatial conformations driven by a number of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, Van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic packing. To understand the functions of proteins at a molecular level, it is often necessary to determine their three-dimensional structure. This is the topic of the scientific field of structural biology, which employs techniques such as X-ray crystallography, {NMR} spectroscopy, and dual polarisation interferometry to determine the structure of proteins.
Protein structures range in size from tens to several thousand amino acids. By physical size, proteins are classified as nanoparticles, between 1–100 nm. Very large aggregates can be formed from protein subunits. For example, many thousands of actin molecules assemble into a microfilament.
A protein generally undergoes reversible structural changes in performing its biological function. The alternative structures of the same protein are referred to as different conformational isomers, or simply, conformations, and transitions between them are called conformational changes.},

Sasisekharan, is a way to visualize energetically allowed regions for backbone dihedral angles ψ against φ of amino acid residues in protein structure. The figure at left illustrates the definition of the φ and ψ backbone dihedral angles (called φ and φ' by Ramachandran). The ω angle at the peptide bond is normally 180°, since the partial-double-bond character keeps the peptide planar. The figure at top right shows the allowed φ,ψ backbone conformational regions from the Ramachandran et al. 1963 and 1968 hard-sphere calculations: full radius in solid outline, reduced radius in dashed, and relaxed tau (N-Cα-C) angle in dotted lines. Because dihedral angle values are circular and 0° is the same as 360°, the edges of the Ramachandran plot "wrap" right-to-left and bottom-to-top. For instance, the small strip of allowed values along the lower-left edge of the plot are a continuation of the large, extended-chain region at upper left.},

It generates the information vital to understand life processes by providing the information required for creating accurate three-dimensional models (namely mapping the position of each and every atom that makes up the studied object). The use of this method begun in the middle of last century following Max von Laue discovery of the phenomenon of diffraction of X-rays by crystals, and the successful application of this discovery for the determination of the electronic distribution within simple inorganic molecules by Sir William Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg. The idea of extension of this method to biological molecules met initially with considerable skepticism. For over two decades many respected scientists doubted whether it could be done. Yet, despite its bottlenecks (some of which are described below), the superiority of X-ray crystallography over all other approaches for shedding light on functional aspects at the molecular level became evident once the first structure was determined. The power of this method inspired continuous efforts and spectacular innovations, which vastly accelerated its incredible expansion. Consequently, over the last six decades biological crystallography has produced a constantly growing number of structures, some of which were considered formidable. This remarkable advance yielded numerous new insights into intricate functional aspects. Owing to space limitation this article focuses on selected studies performed recently and highlights some recent exciting developments.},

It defines a new approach to the classification of proteins that is essentially different from {SCOP}, but retains its best features. The {SCOP}2 classification is described in terms of a directed acyclic graph in which nodes form a complex network of many-to-many relationships and are represented by a region of protein structure and sequence. The new classification project is expected to ensure new advances in the field and open new areas of research.},

They constitute one of the main types of protein (alongside globular, fibrous and membrane proteins).The discovery of {IDPs} has challenged the traditional protein structure paradigm, that protein function depends on a fixed three-dimensional structure. This dogma has been challenged over the 2000s and 2010s by increasing evidence from various branches of structural biology, suggesting that protein dynamics may be highly relevant for such systems. Despite their lack of stable structure, {IDPs} are a very large and functionally important class of proteins. In some cases, {IDPs} can adopt a fixed three-dimensional structure after binding to other macromolecules. Overall, {IDPs} are different from structured proteins in many ways and tend to have distinct properties in terms of function, structure, sequence, interactions, evolution and regulation.},

The integral membrane proteins are further classified as transmembrane proteins that span across the membrane, or integral monotopic proteins, which are to attached to only one side of the membrane. 
Membrane proteins, like soluble globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and disordered proteins, are common. Symbolic of their importance in medicine,  membrane proteins are the targets of over 50\% of all modern medicinal drugs. It is estimated that 20–30\% of all genes in most genomes encode for membrane proteins.
Compared to other classes of proteins, determining membrane protein structures remains a challenge in large part due to the difficulty in establishing experimental conditions that can preserve the correct conformation of the protein in isolation from its native environment.},

A gene location in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16, {IBD}1, that contributes to susceptibility to Crohn's disease has been established through multiple linkage studies1,2,3,4,5,6, but the specific gene(s) has not been identified. {NOD}2, a gene that encodes a protein with homology to plant disease resistance gene products is located in the peak region of linkage on chromosome 16 (ref. 7).

Wild-type {NOD}2 activates nuclear factor {NF}-κB, making it responsive to bacterial lipopolysaccharides; however, this induction was deficient in mutant {NOD}2.

The solution structure of the R347K mutant of {TNFR}-1 {DD} was solved by {NMR} spectroscopy. A total of 20 structures were calculated by means of hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing using a total of 1167 distance constraints and 117 torsion angle constraints. The atomic rms distribution about the mean coordinate positions for the 20 structures for residues composing the secondary structure region is 0.40 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.09 Å for all atoms. The structure consists of six antiparallel α-helices arranged in a similar fashion to the other members of the death domain superfamily. The secondary structure and three-dimensional structure of R347K {TNFR}1-{DD} are very similar to the secondary structure and deduced topology of the R347A {TNFR}1-{DD} mutant. Mutagenesis studies identified critical residues located in α2 and part of α3 and α4 that are crucial for self-interaction and interaction with {TRADD}. Structural superposition with previously solved proteins in the death domain superfamily reveals that the major differences between the structures reside in α2, α3, and α4. Interestingly, these regions correspond to the binding sites of {TNFR}1-{DD}, providing a structural basis for the specificity of death domain interactions and its subsequent signaling event.},

	abstract = {Lipin family members (lipin 1, 2, 3) are bi-functional proteins that dephosphorylate phosphatidic acid ({PA}) to produce diacylglycerol ({DAG}) and act in the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Although other components of the triglyceride synthesis pathway can form oligomeric complexes, it is unknown whether lipin proteins also exist as oligomers. In this study, by using various approaches, we revealed that lipin 1 formed stable homo-oligomers with itself and hetero-oligomers with lipin 2/3. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of lipin 1 mediate its oligomerization in a head-to-head/tail-to-tail manner. We also show that lipin 1 subcellular localization can be influenced through oligomerization, and the individual lipin 1 monomers in the oligomer function independently in catalyzing dephosphorylation of {PA}. This study provides evidence that lipin proteins function as oligomeric complexes and that the three mammalian lipin isoforms can form combinatorial units.},

	abstract = {Existing methods for interpreting protein variation focus on annotating mutation pathogenicity rather than detailed interpretation of variant deleteriousness and frequently use only sequence-based or structure-based information. We present {VIPUR}, a computational framework that seamlessly integrates sequence analysis and structural modelling (using the Rosetta protein modelling suite) to identify and interpret deleterious protein variants. To train {VIPUR}, we collected 9477 protein variants with known effects on protein function from multiple organisms and curated structural models for each variant from crystal structures and homology models. {VIPUR} can be applied to mutations in any organism's proteome with improved generalized accuracy ({AUROC} .83) and interpretability ({AUPR} .87) compared to other methods. We demonstrate that {VIPUR}'s predictions of deleteriousness match the biological phenotypes in {ClinVar} and provide a clear ranking of prediction confidence. We use {VIPUR} to interpret known mutations associated with inflammation and diabetes, demonstrating the structural diversity of disrupted functional sites and improved interpretation of mutations associated with human diseases. Lastly, we demonstrate {VIPUR}'s ability to highlight candidate variants associated with human diseases by applying {VIPUR} to de novo variants associated with autism spectrum disorders.},

	issn = {0027-8424},

	abstract = {Proline is established as a potent breaker of both alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures in soluble (globular) proteins. Thus, the frequent occurrence of the Pro residue in the putative transmembrane helices of integral membrane proteins, particularly transport proteins, presents a structural dilemma. We propose that this phenomenon results from the fact that the structural propensity of a given amino acid may be altered to conform to changes imposed by molecular environment. To test this hypothesis on proline, we synthesized model peptides of generic sequence H2N-(Ser-{LyS})2-Ala- Leu-Z-Ala-Leu-Z-Trp-Ala-Leu-Z-(Lys-Ser)3-{OH} (Z = Ala and/or Pro). Peptide conformations were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy in aqueous buffer, {SDS}, lysophosphatidylglycerol micelles, and organic solvents (methanol, trifluoroethanol, and 2-propanol). The helical propensity of Pro was found to be greatly enhanced in the membrane-mimetic environments of both lipid micelles and organic solvents. Proline was found to stabilize the alpha-helical conformation relative to Ala at elevated temperatures in 2-propanol, an observation that argues against the doctrine that Pro is the most potent alpha-helix breaker as established in aqueous media. Parallel studies in deoxycholate micelles of the temperature-induced conformational transitions of the single-spanning membrane bacteriophage {IKe} major coat protein, in which the Pro-containing wild type was compared with Pro30 --{\textgreater} Ala mutant, Pro was found to protect the helix, but disrupt the beta-sheet structure as effectively as it does to model peptides in water. The intrinsic capacity of Pro to disrupt beta-sheets was further reflected in a survey of porins where Pro was found to be selectively excluded from the core of membrane-spanning beta-sheet barrels. The overall data provide a rationale for predicting and understanding the structural consequences when Pro occurs in the context of a membrane.},

The diverse assortment of codon reassignments present in subcellular organelles and organisms of distinct lineages has 'thawed' the concept of a universal immutable code; it may not be accidental that out of more than 140 amino acids found in natural proteins, only two (selenocysteine and pyrrolysine) are known to have been added to the standard 20-member amino acid alphabet. The existence of phosphoseryl-{tRNA} (in the form of {tRNACys} and {tRNASec}) may presage the discovery of other cotranslationally inserted modified amino acids.},

We applied {HotSpot}3D to {\textgreater}4,400 {TCGA} tumors across 19 cancer types, discovering {\textgreater}6,000 intra- and intermolecular clusters, some of which showed tumor and/or tissue specificity. In addition, we identified 369 rare mutations in genes including {TP}53, {PTEN}, {VHL}, {EGFR}, and {FBXW}7 and 99 medium-recurrence mutations in genes such as {RUNX}1, {MTOR}, {CA}3, {PI}3, and {PTPN}11, all mapping within clusters having potential functional implications. As a proof of concept, we validated our predictions in {EGFR} using high-throughput phosphorylation data and cell-line-based experimental evaluation.
